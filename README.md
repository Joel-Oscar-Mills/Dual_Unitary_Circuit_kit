# Path Integrals in DU circuits by Tile-Sum decomposition

### Problem Setting

This repository is built for computing infinite temperature correlations in the Heisenberg picture between an origin charge time-evolved and a local operator at an arbitrary spatial location. This is computed under a dual-unitary framework (Bertini, Kos, Prosen), where under perfect behaviour we expect infinite temperature correlations to be zero solely at the light cone front, $x = t$.

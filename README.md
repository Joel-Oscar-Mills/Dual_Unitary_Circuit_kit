# Generalized Path/Tile-Sum Algorithm for Computing Operator Correlations 

### Problem Setting

We consider a tensor product of single-site $q$-dimensional Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H} \simeq \mathbb{C}^q$ over a spatial lattice of length $2L$ where $x \in \{-\frac{(L-1)}{2},...,-\frac{1}{2},0,\frac{1}{2},...,\frac{L}{2}\}$. By convention, time evolution is given by layering rows of local unitary gates along the vertical axis of the tensor network. Each local gate $U$ evolves a combined 2-site Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^q \otimes \mathbb{C}^q$ for half a full time step (N.B. another half step is needed to couple sites to both their neighbours within the full step). At $t=0$ we place a local charge operator on the central integer site $x=0$. We compute infinite-temperature correlation functions in the Heisenberg picture, which are nothing more than the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product $\langle \mathbb{U}^{\dagger}_{t}Z_{0}\mathbb{U}_{t} | Z_{x} \rangle$ between our time-evolved origin charge and each local charge operator throughout space. This amounts to contracting a particular tensor network.

Following Bertini, Prosen and Kos we contract the tensor network via a tile-sum decomposition of its $x_{+} \times x_{-}$ causal block - that is, the intersection of the forward light-cone from $(0,0)$ and the reverse light-cone from $(x,t)$ - generalized to cater for tiles of arbitrary dimension $d$. The principal idea is to slice the block into a grid of sub-blocks and merge the internal indices along each face-cut. In contrast to Bertini, Prosen and Kos who use trivial $1\times 1$ sub-blocks ($W$), a perfectly regular partition of the causal block is not possible when either $x_{+}$ or $x_{-}$ are indivisible by $d$. To account for this we must include "trimmings" on the leftmost and bottom edges of the causal block where the tiles may be rectangular with 4 varieties of shape: $\{\(d,d\),\(d,x_{-}\%d\),\(x_{+}\%d,d\),\(x_{+}\%d,x_{-}\%d\)\}$ - we denote these varieties as "Main", "Low-Trim","Left-Trim" and "Corner-Trim" respectively. Under this prescription we partition the causal block and merge the indices as described, resulting in a contraction of fewer albeit larger tensors $T_{M_{a}M_{b}}^{M_{c}M_{d}}$ (w. potentially uneven dimensions).
